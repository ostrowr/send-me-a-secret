# Browser Me a Secret

Implemented in Svelte using the go `encrypt` binaries compiled to WASM!

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv)
